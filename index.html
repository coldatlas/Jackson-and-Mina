 <p> Many people remember Gandhi for his famous hunger strikes, but there’s a lot more to the story. Here are some interesting Gandhi facts that offer a small glimpse into the life of the father of India:
 </p>   <br>

 <ol>
   <li> Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Karamchand was the name of his father. The honorific title Mahatma, or "Great Soul," was given to him in 1914.       </li>
 <li> Gandhi is often called Bapu in India, a term of endearment that means "father."     </li>
 <li> Gandhi fought for much more than independence. His causes included civil rights for women, the abolition of the caste system, and the fair treatment of all people regardless of religion. His mother and father had different religious traditions.      </li>
 <li> Gandhi demanded fair treatment for the untouchables, India’s lowest caste; he underwent several fasts to support the cause. He called the untouchables harijans, which means "children of God."       </li>
 <li> Gandhi ate fruit, nuts, and seeds for five years but switched back to strict vegetarianism after suffering health problems. He maintained that each person should find their own diet that works best. Gandhi spent decades experimenting with food, logging the results, and tweaking his eating choices. He wrote a book named The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism.       </li>
